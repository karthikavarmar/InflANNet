This is an ANN based predictor for the easier vaccine candidate identification of Influenza A. Achieved through the development of a binary classifer for both CTLs and HTLs separately, of Flu A Neuraminidase protein. The dataset that is used to train the model and validate it is given in this repository. 

The tool aka webserver is available for users at https://inflannet-app-9v1.streamlit.app/ 

The UI with a sample prediction looks like below -
